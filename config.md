# Gestures configuration
## Location
`$HOME/.config/gestures.conf`, `$HOME/.config/gestures/gestures.conf` and `$HOME/.gestures.conf`
are the configuration locations. They are read in that order, stopping whenever the first one is
encountered.
## Format
The configuration format is based on s-expressions.

  ;; Currently HAS NO EFFECT

  ;; list of gestures. Available options are `swipe`, `pinch`, `hold` and `rotate`.
  ;; Only `swipe` and `pinch` are currently implemented, others are ignored.

      (direction . N)
      ;; `fingers`: basically can be 3 or 4, because less than three libinput does not recognize
      ;; as a gesture, and AFAICT more than four are not counted
      (fingers . 4)
      ;; `action`: command to execute. Anything that works with `sh -c` should work here.

      (direction . in)
      ;; same as above

    (hold
